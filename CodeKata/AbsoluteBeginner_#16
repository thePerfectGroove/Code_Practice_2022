You are given with Principle amount($), Interest Rate(%) and Time (years) in that order. Find Simple Interest.

Print the output up to two decimal places (Round-off if necessary).

(S.I. = P*T*R/100)

Input Description:
Three values are given to you as the input. these values correspond to Principle amount, Interest Rate and Time in that particular order.

        P_A, I_R, T = list(map(float,input().split()))

        #(S.I. = P*T*R/100)

        S_I = (P_A*T*I_R)/100
        print(S_I)

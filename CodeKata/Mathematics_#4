You are given a number ‘n’. You have to tell whether a number is great or not. A great number is a number whose sum of digits let (m) and product of digits let(j) when summed together gives the number back

m+j=n

 

       num = int(input())
      b = num%10
      c = num//10
      d = b*c
      e = b+c
      f = d + e
      if f == num:
          print("Great")
      else:
          print("no")
